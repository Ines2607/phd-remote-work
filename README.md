## Author  
Inessa Tregubova, PhD student at Hebrew University of Jerusalem

## Project Description  
This repository contains notebooks and datasets created during my PhD research: *"The effect of remote and hybrid working on urban equilibrium and post-pandemic urban recovery."*  
The research focuses on analyzing shifts in commuting and migration patterns in the Gush Dan area in Israel caused by the rise of remote working.  

The main data source is mobile signals data (2019-2023) provided by Habidatum.

## Research Objectives  
- Develop a framework to model urban equilibrium in the context of remote and hybrid work.  
- Assess short-term and long-term effects on local services and urban prosperity.  
- Propose tools for policymakers to simulate and compare scenarios based on policy decisions.

## Data Sources  
- Mobility signals from Unicast provided by Habidatum 
- Israel Census 2022  
- GTFS files  
- Real Estate data (2017-2024)
- Administrative boundaries at different scales  
- Annual Labor force surveys
