# PhD on Remote Work

## Author  
Inessa Tregubova, PhD student at Hebrew University of Jerusalem

## Project Description  
This repository contains notebooks and datasets created during my PhD research: *"The effect of remote and hybrid working on urban equilibrium and post-pandemic urban recovery."*  
The research focuses on analyzing shifts in commuting and migration patterns in the Gush Dan area in Israel caused by the rise of remote working.  

The main data source is mobile signals data (2019-2023) provided by Habidatum.

## Research Objectives  
- Develop a framework to model urban equilibrium in the context of remote and hybrid work.  
- Assess short-term and long-term effects on local services and urban prosperity.  
- Propose tools for policymakers to simulate and compare scenarios based on policy decisions.

## Data Sources  
- Mobility signals from Unicast provided by Habidatum (not publicly available)
- Israel Census 2022
- GTFS files  
- Real Estate data (2017-2024)
- Administrative boundaries at different scales  
- Annual Labor force surveys

## Repository Structure 
- `XXX-(load/process/research)-step-name` - a step in analysis
- `data/` - Raw datasets used in the research (access restrictions may apply)    
- `results/` - Outputs and findings (graphs, tables, etc.)  


## Notebooks Types
- `XXX-the name of step` - the notebook with cleaned code that runs a part of research.Some data might be unavailable.
- `name-Demo` - demonstation notebook that is aimed for public use. It explains the logic and doesn't require private data.  
- `the name of step-research` - intermediate step before creating clean notebook. Mostly published without cleaning


## How to Use  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/inessat/phd-remote-work.git
